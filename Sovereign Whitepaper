### **4.3 Exchange Mechanics**

#### **Stars to Coins Conversion**
```javascript
// Conversion formula
function starsToCoins(stars) {
  const usdValue = stars / 10000; // Convert to USD
  const inrValue = usdValue * 83; // Current USD to INR rate
  const coins = (inrValue / 100) * 10000; // Convert to Coins
  return coins;
}

// Example: 50,000 Stars
// = $5 USD
// = ₹415 INR (at ₹83/$1)
// = 41,500 Coins
```

#### **Service Fee Structure**
```javascript
const FEE_STRUCTURE = {
  starsToCoins: 0.08, // 8% conversion fee
  withdrawal: 0.02,    // 2% withdrawal fee
  charity: 0.45,       // 45% to charity (from profits)
  techDev: 0.45,       // 45% to tech development
