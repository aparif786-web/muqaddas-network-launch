### **Implementation Example in Code**

Here’s how you can implement this structure in your application:

```javascript
// Weekly Tasks and Rewards Implementation
const weeklyRewards = {
    tasks: [
        {
            id: 1,
            description: "12-Hour Broadcast",
            points: 80000
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            description: "18-Hour Broadcast",
            points: 40000
        },
        {
            id: 3,
            description: "24-Hour Broadcast",
            points: 80000
        }
    ],
    totalPoints: function() {
        return this.tasks.reduce((total, task) => total + task.points, 0);
    }
};

// Example Usage
console.log("Weekly Tasks & Rewards:");
weeklyRewards.tasks.forEach(task => {
    console.log(`${task.description}: ${task.points} points`);
});
console.log(`Total Task Reward: ${weeklyRewards.totalPoints()} points`);
```

### **Best Practices Applied:**
- **Modular Design**: Each task is an object in an array, making it easy to add or modify tasks.
- **Dynamic Total Calculation**: The total points are calculated using a function, ensuring accuracy if tasks change.
- **Descriptive Variable Names**: Clear variable and function names for maintainability.
