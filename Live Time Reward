### **Implementation Example in Code**

Here’s a code snippet to implement these features in your application:

```javascript
// Live Time Rewards and Weekly Earnings Implementation
const liveTimeReward = {
    amount: 40, // USD
    frequency: "weekly",
    description: "Fixed reward for star hosts"
};

const weeklyEarnings = {
    maxPoints: 800000, // Maximum points a star host can earn weekly
    pointsToUSD: 0.00005, // Example conversion rate: 1 point = $0.00005
    calculateEarnings: function(points) {
        return points * this.pointsToUSD; // Convert points to USD
    }
};

// Example Usage
console.log("Live Time Reward:");
console.log(`Amount: $${liveTimeReward.amount} ${liveTimeReward.frequency}`);

console.log("\nWeekly Earnings:");
console.log(`Maximum Points Earnable: ${weeklyEarnings.maxPoints}`);
const earningsUSD = weeklyEarnings.calculateEarnings(weeklyEarnings.maxPoints);
console.log(`Potential Earnings ($): $${earningsUSD.toFixed(2)}`);
```

### **Best Practices Applied:**
- **Clear Structure**: Organized data into meaningful objects for better readability and maintainability.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: The function allows easy updates to the points-to-USD conversion rate.
- **Descriptive Variable Names**: Clear naming conventions enhance code clarity.
