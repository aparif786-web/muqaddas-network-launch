function initiateChat(userId, hostId) {
    const cost = 10; // Coins required to chat
    const userBalance = getUserBalance(userId);
    
    if (userBalance < cost) {
        return {
            success: false,
            message: "Insufficient coins to start a chat."
        };
    }
    
    // Deduct coins from user's balance
    updateUserBalance(userId, -cost);
    
    // Credit host's wallet
    const hostEarnings = cost * 0.70; // 70% goes to host
    updateHostWallet(hostId, hostEarnings);
    
    return {
        success: true,
        message: "Chat initiated successfully!",
        remainingBalance: getUserBalance(userId)
    };
