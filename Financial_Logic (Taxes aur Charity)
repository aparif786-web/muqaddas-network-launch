## 2. Charity Allocation Logic

### **Automatic Charity Trigger**
```javascript
const CHARITY_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD = 50000; // ₹50,000 threshold for charity allocation

function allocateCharity(profit) {
    if (profit >= CHARITY_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD) {
        const charityAmount = profit * 0.45; // 45% to charity
        updateCharityVault(charityAmount);
        console.log(`₹${charityAmount} allocated to charity.`);
    }
}
```

### **Example Usage**
```javascript
const profit = 75000;
allocateCharity(profit); // This will allocate ₹33,750 to charity
```

## 3. Tax Calculation

### **Tax Rates**
- **GST**: 18% on service fees
- **Income Tax**: Based on applicable slabs, typically around 30% for businesses.

const GST_RATE = 0.18;
const INCOME_TAX_RATE = 0.30;

function calculateGST(amount) {
    return amount * GST_RATE;
}

function calculateIncomeTax(profit) {
    return profit * INCOME_TAX_RATE;
}

// Example of calculating taxes
const totalServiceFee = 15; // ₹15 service fee
const gst = calculateGST(totalServiceFee);
console.log(`GST on service fee: ₹${gst}`);

const profit = 75000; // Assuming profit is ₹75,000
const incomeTax = calculateIncomeTax(profit);
console.log(`Income Tax on profit: ₹${
