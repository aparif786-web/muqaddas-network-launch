### **Technical Implementation**

#### **1. Database Schema**
Define a schema for users, battles, and challenges:

```javascript
// User Schema
const userSchema = {
    userId: String,
    name: String,
    skillLevel: Number, // E.g., 1-10
    banner: String,
    totalBattles: Number,
    wins: Number,
    losses: Number,
    currentStreak: Number,
    examScores: Array // Scores from exams taken
};

// Battle Schema
const battleSchema = {
    battleId: String,
    participant1: String, // userId
    participant2: String, // userId
    challenge: String,
    startTime: Date,
    endTime: Date,
    winner: String,
    status: String // 'active', 'completed', 'canceled'
};

// Challenge Schema
const challengeSchema = {
    challengeId: String,
    question: String,
    options: Array, // Multiple-choice options
    correctAnswer: String,
    pointValue: Number
};
```

#### **2. API Endpoints**
Create endpoints for matchmaking, battle initiation, and challenge management:

```javascript
// Random Matchmaking
app.get('/api/matchmaking', async (req, res) => {
    const matchedUsers = await findMatch(req.userId
