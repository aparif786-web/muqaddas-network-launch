### **Point Exchange Logic**

**Category**: Finance (Point and Currency Logic)

**Purpose:** Automate the conversion of points earned by hosts into dollars or coins.

### **Conversion Rate**
- **1 Point = $0.01 (1 cent)**
- Minimum points for conversion: **100 Points**

### **Automated Logic**
```javascript
/**
 * Convert earned points to currency (USD or Coins)
 * @param {number} points - Total points earned
 * @returns {Object} - Contains coins or dollars equivalent
 */
function convertPointsToCurrency(points) {
    const MIN_POINTS = 100;
    const CONVERSION_RATE = 0.01; // 1 point = $0.01

    if (points < MIN_POINTS) {
        return {
            success: false,
            message: `Minimum ${MIN_POINTS} points required for conversion.`
        };
    }
    
    const dollars = points * CONVERSION_RATE;
    const coins = Math.floor(points / 10); // Example: 10 points = 1 coin

    return {
        success: true,
        dollars: dollars,
        coins: coins
    };
}

// Example Usage
const result = convertPointsToCurrency(500); // Converts 500 points
console.log(result); // { success: true, dollars: 5.00, coins: 50 }
```

### **Key Features**
- **Automated Conversion**: Users automatically convert points to currency.
- **Minimum Threshold**: Ensures users have enough points before conversion.
- **Transaction Logging**: Keep track of all conversions for auditing.

### **Service Fee Logic**

**Category**: Finance (Point and Currency Logic)

**Purpose:** Implement a permanent service fee and charity deduction logic during the coin exchange process.

### **Service Fee Structure**
- **8% Service Fee** on all star-to-coin exchanges.
- **2% Charity Deduction** for VIP users.

### **Automated Logic**
```javascript
/**
 * Calculate service fee and charity deduction during point exchange
 * @param {number} points - Total points to be converted
 * @param {boolean} isVIP - Whether the user is a VIP
 * @returns {Object} - Contains net
